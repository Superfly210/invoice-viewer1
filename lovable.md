My Question:

**i made some changes to the invoice signer page**

**The idea for the Invoice Signer page focuses on a clear workflow (upload → view → fill form → select position → generate signed PDF), and aligns well with handling batches of invoices/tickets. Leverage client-side PDF manipulation to keep things efficient without heavy server dependencies.** 

**Key Considerations and Suggestions**

 **Upload one or multiple PDFs, display them in a viewer (perhaps in a modal or sidebar for multi-file support). Have a persistent form outside the viewer for the stamp fields (Date, Description, AFE Number/Cost Code, Amount). On click in the viewer, capture the position for the stamp. When the user hits "Sign" or "Stamp," generate a new PDF with the form data overlaid as text (or a simple formatted block) at that position. Output could be a download link or auto-upload to Supabase for storage/retrieval.**

**Handling Multiple PDFs: Use a queue or accordion list (via Shadcn UI's Accordion component) to show uploaded files. Process one at a time: Select a file from the list to load it in the viewer, fill the form (per-file state), stamp, and generate. This avoids overwhelming the UI. Track progress with badges or checkboxes.**

**Challenges:**

**PDF Coordinates: PDF viewers render in browser coordinates (pixels), but PDF editing uses points (1 point = 1/72 inch, origin at bottom-left). You'll need to map click positions accordingly—factor in zoom, scroll, and page dimensions.**
**Multi-Page PDFs: Invoices might span pages. Allow users to select a page in the viewer before clicking for position.**
**Performance: Client-side editing with large PDFs could be memory-intensive; test with real invoices.**
**Security/Validation: Since this is "signing," consider adding user auth (via Supabase) and timestamps. Validate form inputs (e.g., date format, required fields).**
**Edge Cases: Handle read-only PDFs, password-protected files (pdf-lib can unlock if you prompt for password), or non-standard fonts (embed a fallback font like Helvetica)**

**I would like the drop box/file selector to look more like the drop box in invoice submission portal.** 

**Also it doesnt seem to be working when i drop a pdf into it (says failed to loadPDF).**

**CAn you review the code and suggest some edits? Ask any questions you think relevant**

Got it. I reviewed your InvoiceSigner component and the existing Submission Portal upload UI. Here’s what I found and how I suggest we fix both the styling and the PDF load error, plus a couple of quality-of-life improvements for multi-file and page handling.

Key issues identified
- Upload UI: InvoiceSigner uses a plain file input, while the Submission Portal uses a polished dashed border drop box with a hidden input and button trigger. There’s no drag-and-drop handling in either; the portal just looks like it.
- React-PDF worker error: The console shows “Setting up fake worker failed: Failed to resolve module specifier 'pdf.worker.mjs'.” That happens when react-pdf/pdf.js worker isn’t configured for Vite.
- PDF click-to-stamp coordinates: Your click mapping uses the container bounding box, which can be off if the PDF canvas isn’t full width or has padding. This can cause misaligned stamps at different zooms/sizes.
- Multi-page support UX: You track currentPage but don’t give controls to switch pages.
- Supabase upload overwrite: supabase.storage.upload will fail if the file already exists unless you enable upsert.

Targeted edits to propose
1) Match the Submission Portal’s drop area
- Replace the Input file with a dashed border card like the Submission Portal:
  - Icon (Upload), helper text, hidden input with id, and a “Choose File(s)” button.
  - Add drag-and-drop handlers (onDragOver, onDrop) so users can actually drop files into it.
  - For multiple files, render a list with filename and a small remove button (you already have a list; we’ll style it to match).
- Accept attribute: use accept="application/pdf" instead of ".pdf" for better MIME handling.

2) Fix react-pdf worker for Vite
- Add once, at module scope in InvoiceSigner (or centrally in src/main.tsx):
  - import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf'
  - pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.js'
  - You already have public/pdf.worker.min.js in the project; this will satisfy pdf.js in Vite.
- Add onLoadError to Document to log/notify actual errors. Optionally import text/annotation layer CSS for better fidelity.

3) Improve click position accuracy
- Measure the actual canvas inside the Page and use that rect for coordinate math rather than the outer container:
  - Keep a ref to the Page container.
  - Query for canvas within that container on load and use its boundingClientRect() for click position.
  - Map to PDF points using page.getSize() and canvas display width/height:
    - scaleX = pagePointsWidth / canvasDisplayWidth
    - scaleY = pagePointsHeight / canvasDisplayHeight
    - pdfX = (clickX - canvasLeft) * scaleX
    - pdfY = pagePointsHeight - (clickY - canvasTop) * scaleY
- Optionally pass a width prop to Page equal to the measured container width for predictable scaling.

4) Add simple page controls
- Reuse your existing PDFControls-style behavior:
  - Previous page / Next page
  - Show Page X/Y
  - Optional Fit to width and Rotate (not required for stamping but nice to have).
- This makes it clear which page stamping will occur on.

5) Handle multi-file UX cleanly
- Left column: replace the ul list with an Accordion (Radix UI) or a styled list matching the portal look.
- Show active file state and “stamped”/“pending” badges.
- Keep per-file form values by keying form state by file name (or a unique id) so switching files doesn’t lose form entries.

6) Make Supabase uploads reliable
- Use upsert to avoid a collision if the same filename is generated:
  - .upload(`signed_${currentFile.name}`, blob, { upsert: true })
- Consider including a timestamp or UUID in path for uniqueness, e.g., signed/${Date.now()}_${currentFile.name}

7) Validation and UX
- Zod validation is set up. Let’s:
  - Enforce required fields for date and amount (you already require date; consider requiring amount if that’s expected).
  - Date input: optional date picker to reduce formatting errors.
- Add UI cue when a click position is captured (e.g., a small marker on the canvas or a “Position set on Page X” note).

Why the “Failed to load PDF” happens and how this plan fixes it
- React-PDF relies on a worker. In Vite projects, you must explicitly set pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc. Without it, it tries to set up a fake worker and fails, causing PDFs not to render. Setting workerSrc to the public worker fixes the error. We’ll also add onLoadError to surface any remaining issues.

How we’ll test it
- Worker fix:
  - Load a sample PDF and verify no “fake worker” error appears in the console.
  - Confirm Document onLoadSuccess fires, numPages is > 0.
- Drag-and-drop:
  - Drag one PDF into the drop box; it appears in the file list and loads in the viewer.
  - Drag multiple PDFs: all appear in the list; selecting a different one switches the viewer.
  - Click “Choose File(s)” and pick PDFs; same behavior.
- Page navigation:
  - Use next/previous page; ensure current page updates in UI and click-to-stamp sets page correctly.
- Coordinate accuracy:
  - Click near a corner of the visible page. Stamp and download. Open the stamped PDF; confirm text appears near the same corner in the actual PDF.
  - Repeat at different container sizes to confirm mapping is accurate.
- Form and stamping:
  - Fill form fields (Date, Description, AFE/Cost Code, Amount).
  - Click to set position, press Stamp & Generate.
  - Confirm download succeeds and the overlay text is where expected.
  - Confirm upload to Supabase succeeds; if file exists, verify upsert or timestamp path prevents errors.
- Multi-file workflow:
  - Switch between files; verify per-file form values and click positions are retained (if we store them per file).
  - Stamp multiple files in sequence.
- Error handling:
  - Drop a non-PDF file; UI should show a friendly message and ignore it.
  - If a corrupted PDF is dropped, Document onLoadError should show an error toast.

Questions
- Overwrite or versioning: Should we overwrite signed PDFs with the same name (upsert true), or always create a new version (timestamp/UUID in path)? **Overwrite**
- Stamp style: Is plain black Helvetica text OK, or should we add a colored background block/signature-like appearance? **Yes**
- Position marker: Do you want a visible marker after click to confirm placement before stamping? **Yes**

lov-plan
1) Update InvoiceSigner to use a polished drop box like the Submission Portal:
   - Replace the file Input with a dashed border container, Upload icon, helper text, hidden input, and button trigger.
   - Add onDragOver/onDrop handlers to accept drag-and-drop for one or multiple PDFs.
   - Style the file list to match the Submission Portal with icons and remove buttons.

2) Fix React-PDF worker:
   - Add at module scope: import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf'; pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.js';
   - Add onLoadError to Document and surface the error in the UI.

3) Improve page display and controls:
   - Add page navigation (prev/next and Page X/Y display) to select the stamping page.
   - Optionally add fit-to-width and rotate controls.

4) Accurate click-to-PDF coordinate mapping:
   - Use a ref to the Page container; query the canvas element’s bounding rect on load.
   - Compute scale based on page.getSize() and canvas display size to derive pdfX/pdfY reliably.
   - Optionally pass width prop to Page using a measured container width for consistent scaling.

5) Multi-file UX with progress:
   - Replace the simple list with a nicer list or Accordion. Show active file and status (Pending/Stamped).
   - Keep per-file form values by keying form state by file name or id.

6) Reliable Supabase upload:
   - Use upsert: true or timestamped paths to avoid name collisions.
   - Log the final storage path and expose it in the UI after successful upload.

7) Validation and feedback:
   - Keep Zod for form validation; ensure errors are shown inline.
   - Add a visual “position set” indicator and disable “Stamp & Generate” until a position is selected.

8) Testing:
   - Verify worker fix (no console error).
   - Test drag-and-drop + click-choose upload flows.
   - Test multi-page navigation and click mapping accuracy across different sizes.
   - Test multi-file switching and stamping.
   - Verify Supabase upload path and handling of duplicates.
   - Negative tests with non-PDFs and corrupted PDFs.

Implement the plan
