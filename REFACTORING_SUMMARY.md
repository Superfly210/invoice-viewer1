---

## New Folder Structure

```
src/pages/SubmissionPortal/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx                    # Main component (to be created)
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts                     # âœ… Type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useSubmissions.ts        # âœ… Data fetching & management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useSubmissionForm.ts     # âœ… Form state & submission logic
â”œâ”€â”€ components/                  # ðŸ”„ To be created

â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ helpers.ts               # âœ… Helper functions
```

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

### âœ… 1. Types Extracted (`types.ts`)
**File:** `src/pages/SubmissionPortal/types.ts`

**Exports:**
- `CodingRow` - Invoice coding line item
- `Submission` - Full submission data structure
- `SubmissionFormData` - Form state interface
- `SubmissionFilters` - Filter/sort configuration
- `SubmissionStatus` - Status type union
- `StatusConfig` - Badge configuration

**Benefits:**
- Centralized type definitions
- Easy to maintain and update
- Reusable across components
- Better IDE autocomplete

---

### âœ… 2. Data Management Hook (`useSubmissions.ts`)
**File:** `src/pages/SubmissionPortal/hooks/useSubmissions.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Fetch user's submissions from Supabase
- Delete submissions
- Download files from storage
- Loading state management
- Error handling with toasts

**API:**
```typescript
const {
  submissions,      // Submission[]
  loading,          // boolean
  fetchSubmissions, // () => Promise<void>
  deleteSubmission, // (id: string) => Promise<void>
  downloadFile,     // (filePath: string) => Promise<void>
} = useSubmissions();
```

**Benefits:**
- Isolated data fetching logic
- Easy to test
- Reusable in other components
- Clear separation of concerns

---

### âœ… 3. Form Management Hook (`useSubmissionForm.ts`)
**File:** `src/pages/SubmissionPortal/hooks/useSubmissionForm.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage all form state (20+ fields)
- Handle file uploads
- PDF merging logic
- Form validation
- Submit to Supabase
- Edit existing submissions

**API:**
```typescript
const {
  // File states
  invoiceFile, setInvoiceFile,
  supportingDocs, setSupportingDocs,
  
  // Form fields
  invoicingCompany, setInvoicingCompany,
  invoiceNumber, setInvoiceNumber,
  // ... 10+ more fields
  
  // Loading states
  submitting, mergingPDFs,
  
  // Actions
  resetForm,
  handleSubmit,
  loadSubmissionForEdit,
  addCodingRow, removeCodingRow, updateCodingRow,
  addEmailField, removeEmailField, updateEmailField,
} = useSubmissionForm(onSuccess);
```

**Benefits:**
- 250+ lines of logic extracted from component
- Form logic is testable in isolation
- Clear API for form operations
- Easier to add new fields

---

### âœ… 4. Helper Functions (`helpers.ts`)
**File:** `src/pages/SubmissionPortal/utils/helpers.ts`

**Functions:**
- `getStatusBadge(status)` - Returns badge configuration
- `filterAndSortSubmissions(submissions, filters)` - Client-side filtering/sorting

**Benefits:**
- Pure functions (easy to test)
- Reusable across components
- No side effects

---

## Phase 2: Component Extraction (NEXT STEPS)

### ðŸ”„ To Create:

#### 1. `SubmissionList.tsx`
**Purpose:** Display table of submissions with actions

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SubmissionListProps {
  submissions: Submission[];
  loading: boolean;
  onView: (submission: Submission) => void;
  onEdit: (submission: Submission) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
  onDownload: (filePath: string) => void;
}
```

**Size:** ~150 lines

---

#### 2. `SubmissionFilters.tsx`
**Purpose:** Search, filter, and sort controls

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SubmissionFiltersProps {
  searchTerm: string;
  onSearchChange: (term: string) => void;
  statusFilter: string;
  onStatusFilterChange: (status: string) => void;
  sortBy: "date" | "company" | "total";
  sortOrder: "asc" | "desc";
  onSort: (column: "date" | "company" | "total") => void;
}
```

**Size:** ~100 lines

---

#### 3. `SubmissionForm.tsx`
**Purpose:** Invoice submission form (Sheet content)

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SubmissionFormProps {
  form: ReturnType<typeof useSubmissionForm>;
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
}
```

**Size:** ~400 lines (complex form)

**Sub-components to extract:**
- `InvoiceDetailsSection.tsx` (~100 lines)
- `CodingDetailsSection.tsx` (~100 lines)
- `ContactInfoSection.tsx` (~80 lines)
- `FileUploadSection.tsx` (~80 lines)

---

#### 4. `SubmissionDetails.tsx`
**Purpose:** View-only dialog for submission details

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SubmissionDetailsProps {
  submission: Submission | null;
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  onDownload: (filePath: string) => void;
}
```

**Size:** ~150 lines

---

#### 5. Main `index.tsx`
**Purpose:** Orchestrate all components

**Size:** ~150 lines (down from 1000+)

**Structure:**
```tsx
export default function SubmissionPortal() {
  // Hooks
  const submissions = useSubmissions();
  const form = useSubmissionForm(submissions.fetchSubmissions);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<SubmissionFilters>({...});
  
  // Filtered data
  const filteredSubmissions = filterAndSortSubmissions(
    submissions.submissions,
    filters
  );
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Header onLogout={handleLogout} />
      <SubmissionFilters {...filterProps} />
      <SubmissionList {...listProps} />
      <SubmissionForm {...formProps} />
      <SubmissionDetails {...detailsProps} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## File Size Comparison

### Before:
```
SubmissionPortal.tsx: 40,529 bytes (1014 lines)
```

### After (Projected):
```
types.ts:                    ~2 KB (60 lines)
hooks/useSubmissions.ts:     ~4 KB (100 lines)
hooks/useSubmissionForm.ts:  ~9 KB (250 lines)
utils/helpers.ts:            ~2 KB (45 lines)
components/SubmissionList.tsx:    ~6 KB (150 lines)
components/SubmissionFilters.tsx: ~4 KB (100 lines)
components/SubmissionForm.tsx:    ~16 KB (400 lines)
components/SubmissionDetails.tsx: ~6 KB (150 lines)
index.tsx:                   ~6 KB (150 lines)
-------------------------------------------
Total: ~55 KB (1405 lines)
```

**Note:** Total size increased slightly due to:
- Better code organization (more explicit)
- Type safety improvements
- Better error handling
- More comments and documentation

**But each individual file is now:**
- âœ… < 10 KB (except main form)
- âœ… < 250 lines
- âœ… Single responsibility
- âœ… Easy to understand

---

## Migration Strategy

### Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)
1. âœ… Create new folder structure
2. âœ… Extract types and hooks
3. Keep original `SubmissionPortal.tsx` working
4. Create new components one by one
5. Test each component individually
6. Replace old component when ready
7. Delete old file

### Option 2: Big Bang (Risky)
1. Create all new files at once
2. Update imports
3. Test everything
4. Deploy

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 for safer refactoring

## Next Steps

1. **Create `SubmissionList.tsx`**
   - Extract table rendering logic
   - Add proper TypeScript types
   - Test with mock data

2. **Create `SubmissionFilters.tsx`**

   - Break into sub-components
   - Test form validation

4. **Create `SubmissionDetails.tsx`**
   - Extract view dialog
   - Add download functionality
   - Test with mock data

5. **Create main `index.tsx`**
   - Orchestrate all components
   - Connect hooks
   - Test integration

6. **Update imports and routes**
   - Update route configuration
   - Test navigation
   - Verify no regressions

7. **Delete old file**
   - Remove `SubmissionPortal.tsx`
   - Clean up unused imports
   - Update documentation

- [ ] Form submission works (edit)
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] PDF merging works
- [ ] Filtering works
- [ ] Sorting works
- [ ] Search works
- [ ] Delete works
- [ ] Download works
- [ ] View details works
- [ ] Validation works
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Loading states work
- [ ] Logout works

---

## Performance Metrics

### Before:
- Initial load: Full 40 KB file
- Hot reload: ~2-3 seconds
- Bundle size: Large single chunk

### After (Expected):
- Initial load: ~6 KB (index.tsx)
- Lazy load: Components as needed
- Hot reload: < 1 second
- Bundle size: Multiple smaller chunks

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with types** - Makes everything else easier
2. **Extract hooks first** - Reduces component complexity immediately
3. **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Keep components small** - < 200 lines is ideal
5. **Use TypeScript** - Catches errors early
