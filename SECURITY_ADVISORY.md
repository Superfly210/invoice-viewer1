# Security Advisory

## Current Known Vulnerabilities

### HIGH: PDF.js Arbitrary JavaScript Execution (GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è UNRESOLVED - Requires manual intervention

**Affected Package:** `pdfjs-dist@3.11.174` (via `@react-pdf-viewer/core@3.12.0`)

**Severity:** HIGH

**Description:**
PDF.js versions <=4.1.392 are vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution when opening a malicious PDF file. An attacker could craft a PDF that executes arbitrary code in the context of the application.

**Current Situation:**
- `@react-pdf-viewer/core@3.12.0` (latest) depends on `pdfjs-dist@3.11.174`
- `react-pdf@10.0.1` uses the safer `pdfjs-dist@5.3.31`
- No automatic fix available from npm audit

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **KEEPING @react-pdf-viewer** - User requires zoom-to-fit and other advanced features

**Mitigation Options:**

#### Option 1: Switch to react-pdf
Replace `@react-pdf-viewer` with `react-pdf` which uses a newer, patched version:

```bash
npm uninstall @react-pdf-viewer/core @react-pdf-viewer/zoom @react-pdf-viewer/page-navigation @react-pdf-viewer/rotate @react-pdf-viewer/scroll-mode
# react-pdf is already installed with pdfjs-dist@5.3.31
```

**Impact:** Requires refactoring PDFViewer.tsx component
**Status:** ‚ùå REJECTED - User needs @react-pdf-viewer functionality

#### Option 2: Manual Override (Temporary)
Force a newer pdfjs-dist version using npm overrides in package.json:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "pdfjs-dist": "^5.3.31"
  }
}
```

**Warning:** This may cause compatibility issues with @react-pdf-viewer

#### Option 3: Input Validation (Defense in Depth) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Implement strict validation on PDF sources:
- Only allow PDFs from trusted sources (Google Drive in this case)
- Implement server-side PDF scanning/validation
- Use Content Security Policy to limit script execution

**Current Protections in Place:**
‚úÖ PDFs are proxied through Supabase Edge Function (prevents direct client access)
‚úÖ Content Security Policy implemented (limits script execution)
‚úÖ Only authenticated users can access PDFs (authentication required)
‚úÖ PDFs come from trusted Google Drive sources (controlled by admin)
‚úÖ CORS restrictions prevent unauthorized access to proxy
‚úÖ Row Level Security on database (prevents unauthorized data access)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Likelihood:** VERY LOW (PDFs from trusted Google Drive sources only, multiple layers of protection)
- **Impact:** HIGH (arbitrary code execution if exploited)
- **Overall Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM (acceptable with current mitigations)

**Accepted Risk Justification:**
1. PDFs are sourced from trusted Google Drive accounts controlled by the organization
2. Multiple security layers in place (authentication, RLS, CSP, proxy)
3. User requires @react-pdf-viewer functionality for business operations
4. Monitoring in place for library updates

**Recommendation:**
1. ‚úÖ **Immediate:** Document this vulnerability and monitor for updates - DONE
2. ‚úÖ **Ongoing:** Monitor @react-pdf-viewer for security updates
3. üîÑ **Long-term:** Re-evaluate when @react-pdf-viewer updates pdfjs-dist dependency

**Tracking:**
- Issue opened: [Date]
- Target resolution: [Date]
- Assigned to: [Name]
