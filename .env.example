# Supabase Configuration
# =====================
# These environment variables are required for the application to connect to Supabase.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.

# Your Supabase Project URL
# Example: https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=

# Your Supabase Project ID
# Example: your-project-id
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=

# Supabase Publishable (Anonymous) Key
# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTE: This is the ANON key, which is safe for client-side use.
# This key is designed to be publicly exposed in your frontend code.
# It only grants access according to your Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
# DO NOT use the service_role key here - that must remain server-side only.
# Example: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# =====================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# =====================
# 
# 1. VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is the "anon" key - safe for frontend
#    - This key is embedded in your client-side JavaScript bundle
#    - It's protected by your Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
#    - Never use the "service_role" key in client-side code
#
# 2. Always ensure your .env file is in .gitignore (already configured)
#
# 3. For production deployments, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform:
#    - Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Netlify: Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
#    - Docker: Use docker-compose.yml or --env-file flag
#
# 4. Row Level Security (RLS) is your primary defense:
#    - Always enable RLS on all Supabase tables
#    - The anon key can only do what RLS policies allow
#    - Review your RLS policies regularly
#
# 5. Never commit the actual .env file with real credentials
